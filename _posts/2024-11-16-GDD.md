## CERNUS Game Design Document

---

#### 1. **Game Overview**

   - **Game Title**: *CERNUS*
   - **Genre**: Sci-Fi Exploration and First person shooter
   - **Platform(s)**: PC (primary), with potential for console adaptation
   - **Target Audience**: Sci-fi fans, FPS fans who enjoy games like *halo*, *valorant* and *apex legends*

   - **Game Summary**:
     - Set in the far future where breakthroughs in technology allow for FTL travel and hyper intelligent AI, *CERNUS* follows the *CERNUS Initiative*—humanity's first steps towards interstellar exploration. Players control an *Exploritor*, a highly customizable robotic unit sent to explore, mine, and research across alien worlds, ruins of alien civilizations, and even bases and space stations of rival Exploritors. Representing one of three rival factions, players will come into conflict with other Exploritors. The game focuses on the clash between survival, exploitation, and preservation as humanity struggles to rebuild in a fractured galaxy.

#### 2. **Core Gameplay Mechanics**

   - **Combat**:
     - CERNUS is focused on movement based FPS gameplay with slow time to kill and a low skill floor with a high skill ceiling
     - Health is a multi faceted system, with cores and casings
     - The players Exploritors have their casing health, which is regeneratable, and is the main body of their Exploritor
     - Once the casing is broken it exposes the Exploritors Core, which is a one hit kill. 
     - The key idea is to balance strategy with mechanical skill, with players who are very good at FPS games being able to match up against players who are less experienced still being able to hold their own by leveraging the systems in place
     - Disincentivize playing the game like call of duty or like any other shooter.

   - **Faction-Based Gameplay**:
     - Players choose one of multiple factions, each with unique perks, abilities, and missions:
       - **Kronenbuerger Division**: The Kronenbuerger Division is a faction focused on extracting and exploiting resources to fuel humanity's progress. They are known for their heavy-duty Exploritor drones and industrial equipment, and prioritize efficiency and progress over environmental concerns.
       - **Applied and Relative Sciences Agency**: ARSA is a faction dedicated to advancing human knowledge and understanding of the universe through scientific research and development. They prioritize the preservation of alien worlds and are known for their sophisticated, well-educated Exploritors who are willing to share their discoveries.
       - **Forefront**: Forefront is a faction dedicated to maintaining cohesion and unity among the Exploritor divisions. They prioritize peacekeeping and diplomacy, and are known for their lightweight robots designed to disable enemies rather than destroy them.
       - **Galiedon**: Galiedon is a faction dedicated to preserving and promoting life in the universe. They specialize in terraforming and biotechnology, and prioritize growth, sustainability, and coexistence with alien biospheres.

   - **Customization and Upgrades**:
     - Players can customize their *Exploritor* with various modules and equipment tailored to their faction’s goals or play style.
     - Available upgrades include movement enhancements (Gravity manipulation, Dash), sensory upgrades (Core detection, Scanner Drones), and utility tools Deployable Shields, Repair bubbles).
     - The upgrade path is nonlinear, allowing players to adapt to the challenges of each alien world.

#### 3. **Narrative and Worldbuilding**

   - **Backstory**:
     - After World War III devastated Earth, humanity united under the *World Peace Commission* (WPC) to ensure survival in space. The *CERNUS Initiative* was formed, deploying autonomous *Exploritors* to seek habitable worlds, vital resources, and scientific knowledge.
     - Three distinct factions arose within the WPC, each with its own agenda: Kronenbuerger (resource-driven), Astral (science-oriented), and Forefront (diplomatic and peaceful).
     - The WPC’s unity is strained as each faction seeks dominance over galactic resources, leading to cross-factional competition and moral ambiguity.

   - **Lore Documents and In-Game Texts**:
     - Players encounter lore documents, journals, and scientific logs that provide insights into the *CERNUS Initiative*, faction backstories, and prior missions. These texts flesh out the world and provide context for the philosophical conflicts at play.
     - Personal logs from past *Exploritors* or historical data entries can reveal secrets, adding mystery and a sense of continuity to the narrative.

   - **Alien Life and Environments**:
     - Each alien world has its own ecosystem, populated by unique flora and fauna. Certain lifeforms may provide resources, others might be hostile, and some may even interact with or respond to players' actions.
     - Environmental storytelling (e.g., alien ruins, relics of failed human outposts) adds depth to each planet and hints at previous attempts to survive or thrive there.

#### 4. **Technical and Art Direction**

   - **Visual Style**:
     - A blend of realistic and stylized sci-fi visuals, using a muted color palette with pops of vibrant alien colors to reflect the stark contrast between mechanical human technology and organic alien worlds.
     - The environments should look rugged and desolate, but also mysterious and beautiful, capturing the feeling of discovery and isolation.

   - **User Interface (UI)**:
     - The UI should be minimalistic and sleek, with HUD elements providing essential information on resources, environmental hazards, and factional status.
     - A faction-specific UI overlay (color-coded or with icons) can help players quickly identify their affiliation and status with other factions.

   - **Audio**:
     - Ambient, atmospheric sound design with a mix of high BPM rock and metal music music like *Dragonforce*, *ACDC*, and *Van Halen* and environmental sounds to immerse players in the alien landscapes and other maps.
     - The soundscape should reflect the high speed gameplay and smooth movement, punctuated by the sounds of technology and robotics.

#### 5. **Prototype Goals**

   - **Exploration Mechanics**:
     - Develop an initial map that players can explore and fight in, using movement mechanics and combat.

   - **Basic Faction System**:
     - Let players choose one of the factions and experience the distinct perks and limitations.

   - **Upgrades**:
     - Implement a prototype upgrade system where players can upgrade their *Exploritor*
     - Include a simple UI for health and movement.

   - **Story Elements**:
     - Include a few lore documents or logs that give hints about the backstory, faction motivations, or details about Earth’s state.

#### **ICEBOXED** 
---
These concepts and ideas are things that I may or may not add depending on time, and/or the way the game goes in the future.
   - **Resource Management(Iceboxed)**:
     - Players must gather and manage resources essential for survival and upgrades (e.g., fuel, minerals, data cores, alien samples).
     - Resources are finite on each planet, forcing players to balance between extraction and conservation. Over-extraction could lead to consequences like environmental hazards or penalties from rival factions.
     - Each faction has unique resource needs, reflecting their philosophical priorities (e.g., Kronenbuerger needs heavy metals, Astral focuses on data and samples).

   - **Decision-Making and Cross-Faction Conflict(Iceboxed)**:
     - Choices players make—such as over-extraction, conflict with local alien species, or aggressive research—can strain or strengthen relationships with other factions.
     - Periodic encounters with rival faction bots or leaders introduce additional tension, requiring players to negotiate, compete, or fight for resources.
     - Players’ actions can also impact the alien environments. For example, mining too aggressively may cause ecological backlash or disrupt alien lifeforms, leading to future difficulties.

   - **Exploration(Iceboxed)**:
     - Players explore alien planets with varying biomes, resources, and dangers. Each world offers unique challenges, like extreme climates, indigenous lifeforms, or unstable geologic structures.
     - The game encourages systematic exploration and provides tools for terrain analysis, resource scanning, and environmental monitoring.
     - Certain biomes or areas may require specific upgrades or equipment, adding a puzzle-like element to accessing new zones.
