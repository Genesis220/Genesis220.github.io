# Faction Name
---
Kronenbuerger Division, CEF-8
## Meta Commentary
---
I wanted to mix the aesthetic and themes of German Industrialism and Native American Culture, which I think is an interesting premise for the Kronenbuerger Divisions general theme. 
## Origin and Purpose 
---
CEF-8 was originally made to expedite the processing of raw materials and exploitation of natural resources. A lack of resources, and a general lack of throughput limited the scope of projects and initiatives that humanity was able to achieve. 

## Organizational Structure & Philosophy
---
The Kronenbuerger division provides resources and low level technology to any CERNUS Exploratory fleet, and almost anyone that asks and has a goal behind them.

The Kronenbuerger division holds to their core principle, known as "Sesh-Tat", or "a dying man's memory, a corpse a flower", or in other words, when you take, remember, and don't waste the dead. Their only quality that they hold other fleets to, which is to give back in equal face. 

The black sheep of CERNUS, the Kronenbuerger division comes under often scrutiny for their "planetary exploitation", and the Kronenbuerger Division often never disputes the claims. Almost always non diplomatic, the Kronenbuerger division is almost always silent when it comes to negotiation and diplomatic relations, their ships lying idle in wait until a first shot is landed. Very rarely they will engage in diplomatic, most often with Forefront, which they have better relationships with.

*"the only sin greater than killing is leaving the body to rot"*

*"the blood on our hands will always remain. The only dignity we can have is keeping our hands to ourselves"*

The Kronenbuerger division sees themselves as "The blood covered hands of humanity", pointing out the hypocrisy of other CERNUS Fleets, which criticize the Kronenbuerger division for their exploitative measures, but using their freely available resources without complaint.
## Technology and Area of Expertise
---
Most often known for their industrial, heavy and mechanical equipment that prioritizes raw strength and power over precision. Their technology uses mainly takes advantage of pneumatic photon compression technology, which allows for near relativistic speeds. Their technology is blunt and efficient, but lacks precision or nuance

Their combat weapons mainly are long distance heavy weapons, based off retrofitted orbital bombardment technology, or close range destruction technology, like flame cannons, grenade launchers, or mining shotguns.

The Kronenbuerger division maintains an artificial superstructure, known as the Seshanan-Valak, is dedicated to the maintenance and preservation of alien biospheres and resources. The Seshanan-Valak is a superstructure consisting of 5.3 light hours of structural framework, where the Kronenbuerger Division maintains biospheres, processes materials, collects data, and acts as a general hub for the Kronenbuerger divisions activities. The Seshanan-Valak's central node, the Semenara, is a data processing center over 3 light seconds across, houses over <--!REDACTED--> Trifolium particles, and houses backups of all the DNA, RNA, and data from every single system and planet the Kronenbuerger division has come across. 
## Playstyle
---
The Kronenbuerger Division is the tanks of CERNUS. They have high Heath, damage over time, but slow movement. 

The main idea behind the Kronenbuerger division is high survivability and tolerance for error. They're tanks with high health, and can mow through enemies, take land, but struggle against multiple enemies and situations where they're isolated.
