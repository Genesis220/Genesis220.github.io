# The Importance of Communication Part 1

## Introduction
---

As someone who's lived in several different places in several different countries, and never figured out communication until recently, (I still don't have it fully figured out!) this is going to be a multiple part series in breaking down communication in a way I've found intuitive and helpful. I'm generally someone who's logical and calculating, and oftentimes forgets about feelings and the more irrational side of humanity, and distilling those more human emotions into rational explanations for actions is what allowed me to (mostly) fit in. This isn't an do X to get Y guide, and I can't guarantee it'll work for you, What this is, is a breakdown of social norms, customs, and my interpretation on how to best handle those situations. I'm not here to solve your problems, I'm here to give you the power to solve them.

## What is Communication?
---
Communication is probably the most important aspect in life. Communication, and more broadly the transfer and exchange of information across parties is part of the foundation that makes up communities, societies, and people as a whole. Even inside you, organ systems, organs, groups of cells, and individual cells communicate with each other to make sure the idea that is "you" stays alive. This is technically an example of communication, when we refer to communication, we usually refer to communication between individuals and parties, not the basic communication that makes up our constituent parts. In order to have a better understanding of communication as a whole though, it's important to examine communication as a whole. 

## Different types of Communication
---
In the approximate 300,000 years that humanity has existed, communication has evolved and changed drastically just as we have. Culture, Ideologies, and Individuals have influenced the standards, norms, and nuances that effect everyday communication. We usually separate communication into two distinct groups, verbal communication and nonverbal communication. Verbal communication is most often defined as communication stated through the spoken word, and nonverbal communication is the nuance that surrounds how we speak the words, our actions during the interaction, and other pieces of information we don't explicitly say. 

The problem with this way of thinking is, sometimes it just doesn't line up. Take, for example, sarcasm. Sarcasm and Irony use the unaddressed and unsaid as the explicit system of delivery. The phase "pot, meet kettle" alludes to the idea that the person being addressed is ignorant of the hypocrisy in the action or accusation their taking. The message is entirely based on the implicit meaning of the phrase, not the explicit words being said. Furthermore, when we extend communication to digital mediums, the verbal-nonverbal dichotomy further breaks down, so lets explore a better alternative.

## Explicit vs Implicit Communication
---
To me, a better distinction is Explicit Communication vs Implicit Communication. 

**Explicit Communication**: The clear, direct message being conveyed through words or actions.

**Implicit Communication**: The subtext, context, or unspoken meaning inferred from the explicit message.

This distinction is much clearer, and we can use it to easily classify and understand different types and techniques used in communication. 

Lets use an example to show how explicit and implicit communication can make analysis and explanation more intuitive. Let's consider flirting and pickup lines as a good example (God forbid I try and understand romance). The phrase "Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?" is an explicit admission of one's physical attraction, comparing someone to an angel, but the implicit message is far more subtle. The line is so cliche that it implies the speaker isn't fully serious in an "only an idiot would use this line on a girl he liked" way, but it can also be a display of the speakers confidence, using an almost ironic line to capture interest and open room for conversation. 

## What's so important about communication? 
---
As humans, our communication is a crude interpretation of our actual, pure intentions. We don't have the elegance and efficiency of a fiber optic cable, photons of light carrying a near perfect replica of a message halfway across the world, or from my keyboard to your screen. Instead, we need to relay on vibrations in the air and crude representations of our thoughts. I can never explain exactly what I'm thinking, and you can't understand exactly what I say. As always, data is lost through the transfer of information, and we often forget that, assuming our exact intentions, ideas, and thoughts are what comes out of us and the problem is other people refuse to see the truth. 

Ever since humans have been smashing rocks together, we've continued to refine and polish our mediums of expression. From the oldest cave painting made from pigments on rock, to the surreal experiences that videogames and VR can provide to us now, art has been about perfecting our expression, or even just admiring it. The arms race to express keeps growing even in peace, and communication is the core of that dream. Just as our tools for expression have grown more sophisticated, so too must our personal communication skills. As we improve our communication, we improve our ability to collaborate, and our ability to create mutual benefit. Next week, we'll explore some of the actions we can take to improve our communication.
