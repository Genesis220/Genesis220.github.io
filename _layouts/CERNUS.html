										<h1>What is CERNUS?</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/CERNUS logo 2.svg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Dive into the fast-paced, movement-driven combat of CERNUS, a sci-fi exploration and first-person shooter that combines precision and strategy. Players take control of an Exploritor, a customizable robotic unit with unique abilities tailored to factional goals and personal playstyles. Featuring dynamic upgrades, intricate health mechanics, and faction-specific perks, CERNUS challenges players to master both survival and tactical dominance. Combat is designed to be accessible yet rewarding, with a low skill floor and a high skill ceiling. With regenerating casing health and a vulnerable two-hit core, every encounter demands thoughtful positioning, teamwork, and adaptability. Whether navigating treacherous alien landscapes or engaging in tense battles with rival Exploritors, the gameplay ensures a balance between strategy and skill.</p>
									<p>Set in the aftermath of humanity's near-destruction, CERNUS explores the delicate balance between survival, innovation, and ethical dilemmas. After the devastation of World War III, the World Peace Commission (WPC) initiated the CERNUS Initiative to send autonomous Exploritors into the stars in search of resources and knowledge. Over time, humanity splintered into rival factions, each driven by unique philosophies: the resource-hungry Krtwonbuerger Division, the scientific minds of ARSA, the peacekeepers of Forefront, and the life-preserving Galiedon. As the galaxy becomes a battleground for survival and dominance, players will uncover secrets of alien civilizations, explore mysterious ruins, and face moral quandaries that question humanity's future among the stars.</p>
									<p>In CERNUS, gameplay and story are deeply intertwined, offering players a seamless blend of immersive narrative and engaging mechanics. Each faction introduces unique motivations and playstyles, creating a rich environment for competitive and cooperative interactions. With new worlds to navigate, lore to discover, and upgrades to unlock, every mission is a step further into a fractured galaxy brimming with opportunities and dangers. Looking ahead, CERNUS aims to expand with additional factions, planets, and gameplay modes, ensuring a universe that evolves as players delve deeper into its mysteries. Whether you're drawn to its fast-paced FPS combat or its compelling story of survival and division, CERNUS promises an experience that challenges the mind as much as the trigger finger.</p>
