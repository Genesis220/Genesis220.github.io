                                                <p>I'm Nathan Lau, an Asian Canadian student, writer, and problem solver. Originally from Hong Kong, I moved to Canada at the age of four and have spent most of my life in Toronto. Living with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) has shaped my perspective, and I’m passionate about helping other neurodivergent individuals navigate their challenges. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, creating miniatures and dioramas, developing and playing video games, and working with both hardware and software. I’m also a big fan of pop culture, especially Warhammer 40,000 and Lord of the Rings.</p>
                                                <p>I’ve been fascinated with computers and problem-solving for as long as I can remember. I built my first computer at 13 and have been refining my skills ever since. Now, I run the <a href="computers.html" class="link" target="_blank">Eglinton and Yonge Computer Company</a>, where I focus on building, repairing, and teaching people how to make the most of their computers. To me, a computer is more than just a tool—it’s a gateway to the vast sum of human knowledge. My goal is to help others unlock that potential by teaching them how to care for and utilize their devices effectively.</p>
                                                <p>Throughout my life, I've believed in asking not just any questions, but the ones we tend to avoid—whether because we’re uncomfortable with the answers or uncertain of them. Questions like: What is our purpose? Why should we care about others? What is happiness? While these may seem straightforward, truly understanding the depth behind them requires effort and determination. I love reading and writing because they allow us to explore these themes in a safe, thought-provoking way. Stories challenge protagonists with questions that mirror our own, enabling us to reflect without directly facing those dilemmas ourselves.</p>
                                                <p>I appreciate you taking the time to stop by my site and read a bit about me.
